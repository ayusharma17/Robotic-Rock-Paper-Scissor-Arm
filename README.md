# Robotic-Rock-Paper-Scissor-Arm
Hey! This Github repository is to document my process of me building my rock paper scissor hand and to help anyone interested make one of their own.
Before I begin, the hand design is not mine.

## Building The Glove
The glove is worn by the user and is used to read user input. It is equipped with 5 flex sensors which send input to the Arduino. Building the glove was easier as compared to building the robotic hand, however, building the glove had it's own ups and downs.
### Flex Sensors
The first thing you need are the flex sensors. I chose to create my own flex sensors but store bought flex sensors should work just fine. 
#### What You need (Links ):
* Couple sheets of paper
* A pencil
* [A transparent flexible sheet](https://www.amazon.com/Polystyrene-Flexible-Modeling-Projects-Paintings/dp/B0968YG7ZR/ref=sr_1_13?crid=3H9RM80XCE6C7&keywords=flexible%2Bperspex%2Bsheet&qid=1658641150&sprefix=flexible%2Bperspex%2Bsheet%2Caps%2C256&sr=8-13&th=1) (You only need 1 or 2 depending on how many flex sensors you want to make)
* [Multi Core Wires](https://www.amazon.com/Elegoo-EL-CP-004-Multicolored-Breadboard-arduino/dp/B01EV70C78/ref=sr_1_6?crid=26UAPN9GRYGZ1&keywords=jumper%2Bwires&qid=1658641292&sprefix=jumper%2Bwire%2Caps%2C292&sr=8-6&th=1) (You need 2 per flex sensors but they can get ruined when you try and strip them so get extra)

I don't think I'll be able explain how to make these better than this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJNYbSpvlP8).


Create 5 such flex sensors
